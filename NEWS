solr 0.1.6
===============

MINOR IMPROVEMENTS

* Import non-base R functions to comply with CRAN requirements (#76)

solr 0.1.4
===============

NEW FEATURES

* Removed R version dependency in DESCRIPTION file, didn't seem to be a reason for it, (#25).
* Removed redundant code from multiple functions to single functions in zzz.r file.

solr 0.1.3
===============

NEW FEATURES

* Added function `solr_group()`, and started group parser, to do grouping searches.
* Fixed `solr_*` functions so that you pass in many fields as a vector e.g., (`c('field1','field')`), rather than as a comma-separated string e.g., `'field1,field'` (#22).
* Added a message to each `solr_*` function to print HTTP uri. Can be suppressed with `verbose=FALSE`.
* Started `solr_all` function to try to integrate all things into one function, as everthing is just parameters passed to the same URL - we'll see how useful though.

solr 0.1.0
===============

NEW FEATURES

* released to CRAN
